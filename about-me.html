        <h2 class="primary-title">Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I’m <b>Alessandro Tasca</b>, an <b>Android Developer</b> with two years of 
            professional experience. I have a high school diploma in Information 
            Technology and a <b>bachelor’s degree</b> in <b>Computer Science</b> from the 
            University of Milano-Bicocca. My <b>passion for Android development</b> 
            really took off during university, and I even created an Android app 
            as the centerpiece of my bachelor’s thesis.

            <p>
                I’m driven by the desire to create real, tangible applications that 
                <b>solve meaningful problems</b> for users. There’s something powerful about 
                <b>building tools that make a difference</b> in people’s lives.<br>I’m also 
                fascinated by the <b>inner workings of technology</b> and always look for ways 
                to deepen my understanding by <b>learning new tools and techniques</b>.

                My drive to develop practical solutions has recently led to a major 
                success with <b>Enel</b>, where <b>I built an app from the ground up</b> for their 
                <b>field operators</b>. After earning client approval, the app is now on its 
                way to <b>production</b>, which has been incredibly rewarding.

                Another project I’m proud of is <b>Super Dim</b>, an app I created for users who, 
                like me, are sensitive to bright lights. It allows them to lower their 
                screen brightness below the usual minimum, making screens more comfortable 
                to use. Since its release, Super Dim has reached <b>8k downloads</b> and has 
                gained <b>50+ premium users</b> who rely on it daily, reinforcing my passion for 
                building solutions that truly help people.

    <div class="content-container">
        <p>
            When I’m not programming, you can find me <b>playing guitar</b> or digging into 
            my <b>retro games collection</b>. Music and classic games are both big passions of 
            mine and give me a creative outlet outside of work.
